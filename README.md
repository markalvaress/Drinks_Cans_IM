# Self-heating drinks cans

This repo is for a group project for the [Industrial Mathematics](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/21-22/dpt/cxmath11231.htm) course at Edinburgh University. We model a self-heating drinks can, where a heating element at the bottom heats up the liquid. We will explore how the temperature distribution changes over time in the liquid and how this depends on various parameters, chiefly by using the [heat equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation).

The observations used in our report are in the "Observations" notebook.
